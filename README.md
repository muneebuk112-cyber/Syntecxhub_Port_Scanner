\# TCP Port Scanner



\## Internship

Cybersecurity Internship – Syntecxhub  

Week 1 Task – Project 1



\## Project Description

This project is a Python-based TCP Port Scanner developed as part of the Syntecxhub Cybersecurity Internship.

It scans a target host to identify open TCP ports, which helps in understanding network exposure and

basic reconnaissance techniques used in Security Operations Centers (SOC).



\## Features

\- Scans open TCP ports on a target host

\- Uses socket programming

\- Multi-threaded scanning for better performance

\- Timeout handling to avoid delays

\- Exception handling for stability



\## Technologies Used

\- Python 3.11

\- Socket Programming

\- ThreadPoolExecutor (Concurrency)



\## Target Used

scanme.nmap.org  

(Official Nmap authorized test server)



\## How to Run the Project

1\. Open terminal in the project folder

2\. Run the command:

&nbsp;  python tcp\_port\_scanner.py



\## Output Example

\[OPEN] Port 22  

\[OPEN] Port 80  

\[✓] Scan completed.



\## Disclaimer
